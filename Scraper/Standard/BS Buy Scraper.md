### Tech

VS Buy's Scraper uses:

* Beautiful Soup / Request 
* Plotly
* Reg Ex
* Pandas

Yeap, that's all. Even numpy was out by the not considerate None value cases. This is an almost 100% handmade scraper.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

In the way of making a standrized e-commerce page, some issues where solve and some others remain in mistery. As you navegate more in the code, you could watch some weird cases where the same page returns the info on a distinct format, so feel free of making it yours.
